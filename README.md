# Hi there, I'm Sushant Jasraüëã

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Leicester (graduating 2026), passionate about developing technology to solve complex problems and continuously expanding my knowledge in areas like software development, data analysis, UI/UX and AI. I'm currently preparing for my third-year project and am always eager to learn and apply new skills.
I approach challenges with an analytical mindset and enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments and believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact.

This profile showcases a range of my work, including foundational projects from my earlier studies and ongoing development projects from my BSc in Computer Science.
